# Memory Optimization Guide for CarRental-Copilot

This document describes the memory optimizations implemented to resolve high memory usage in the AKS deployment.

## Problem Statement

The car-rental-app deployment was experiencing high memory usage with:
- Memory requests: 256Mi per pod
- Memory limits: 512Mi per pod  
- 3 replicas = 1.5GB total memory allocation
- Risk of pod eviction and cluster resource pressure

## Root Causes Identified

1. **N+1 Query Problem**: Dashboard loaded ALL customers, vehicles, and rentals on page load
2. **Lack of Pagination**: Controllers loaded entire datasets without limits
3. **Image Loading**: Vehicle queries loaded all images for all vehicles simultaneously  
4. **No Connection Pooling**: New database connections created/disposed repeatedly
5. **Blazor Server State**: No memory limits on SignalR circuits

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Efficient Count Queries

**Before**: Loading full datasets just to count items
```csharp
totalCustomers = customerController.SelectAll().Count;  // Loads ALL data
```

**After**: Direct count queries
```csharp
totalCustomers = customerController.GetCount();  // SELECT COUNT(*) only
```

### 2. Database Connection Pooling

**Before**: `Pooling=False` in connection string
**After**: `Pooling=True;Min Pool Size=1;Max Pool Size=10`

### 3. Blazor Server Circuit Optimization

```csharp
// Limit concurrent processing
options.MaximumParallelInvocationsPerClient = 1;

// Reduce memory buffering  
options.MaxBufferedUnacknowledgedRenderBatches = 2;
```

### 4. .NET Garbage Collection Tuning

```yaml
env:
- name: DOTNET_gcServer
  value: "0"                    # Workstation GC (lower memory)
- name: DOTNET_GCConserveMemory
  value: "9"                    # Maximum conservation
```

### 5. Kubernetes Resource Right-sizing

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "128Mi"  # Reduced from 256Mi
    cpu: "100m"      # Reduced from 250m
  limits:
    memory: "256Mi"  # Reduced from 512Mi
    cpu: "300m"      # Reduced from 500m
```

## Results

- **50% memory reduction**: 1.5GB â†’ 768MB total cluster allocation
- **Faster dashboard loading**: Count queries vs full data loading
- **Better resource efficiency**: Connection pooling reduces overhead
- **Maintained functionality**: All features work as before

## New Controller Methods

### CustomerController
- `GetCount()`: Returns total customer count

### VehicleController  
- `GetCount()`: Returns total vehicle count
- `GetAvailableCount()`: Returns available vehicle count
- `SelectAllWithoutImages()`: Memory-efficient vehicle loading

### RentalController
- `GetActiveRentalCount()`: Returns count of active rentals

## Best Practices for Future Development

1. **Always use count queries** for dashboard statistics instead of loading full datasets
2. **Enable connection pooling** for database connections
3. **Lazy load related data** (like images) only when needed
4. **Configure GC settings** for memory-constrained environments
5. **Right-size Kubernetes resources** based on actual usage patterns
6. **Monitor memory usage** in production and adjust as needed

## Monitoring Recommendations

- Set up memory usage alerts at 80% of limits
- Monitor connection pool usage
- Track dashboard page load times
- Watch for pod evictions due to memory pressure

## Deployment Notes

These optimizations are production-ready and maintain backward compatibility. No breaking changes were introduced to the API or user experience.
